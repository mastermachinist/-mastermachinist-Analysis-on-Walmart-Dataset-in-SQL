Part I : Objectives


Food is part and parcel of life and people look for meals, food products, food businesses and
restaurants over internet all the time. Competitors also seek information about each other in
the food industry. This leads to investments in food technology as well. From the given dataset
that we will work on emphasis on the Food sales of a particular company. This food database
facilitates users in accessing information and an additional advantage of these databases is that
the users can manage their health and make healthy eating decisions.


Fields include:
● Item_Identifier - Unique identifier for each product.
● Item_Weight – Product weight.
● Item_Fat_Content – Fat content of the product.
● Item_Type – Product category.

● Outlet_Type - Whether the store is a grocery store or a supermarket.
● Item_Outlet_Sales - Sales of the product in each store.


Products are spread across many Outlets which are located in different areas. One factor
affecting a product sales in one area does not affect the product in another area. Customers also
have different qualities that affect their purchasing activities.
I will divide the levels into different categories.


Store Level hypotheses
1. City type: Stores located in large cities are likely to have high sales levels because of the
populations densities there as compared to stores in smaller cities.
2. Location: Stores located in popular market are areas sre likely to have high sales.
3. Economic Growth: Stores located in areas with higher economic growth are expected
to realize higher sales.
4. Store Size: Size of the Outlet will also determine its sales record.
Product level Hypotheses
1. Brand: Branded products are likely to have higher sales volumes as compared to
unbranded products.
2. Utility: Products used daily are highly likely to be purchased.
3. Health Content: Depends on the user’s preference they like.
